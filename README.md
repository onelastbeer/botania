# Botania

## Building and running
I use [docker-compose](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-compose). Make sure you have it installed and type in your
terminal from the root of the project:
```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
You can then browse to [localhost:8083](http://localhost:8083/).
